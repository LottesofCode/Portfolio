## Project 

A look into the effect of day, time, year and gender on the severity of road accidents in the UK between 2016 to 2020.  

## Method

Sorted and analysed data using Excel and MS SQL Server.  
Code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/LottesofCode/Road-Traffic-Accidents-UK/blob/main/SQLCarAccidents.sql)

## Results
A selection of results are displayed in this [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/UKRoadTrafficAccidentsSeverity2016-2020/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).  

-  Men are twice as likely to have a fatal accident and 1.25 times more likely to be involved in a serious collision compared to women. 
-  The majority of mild and severe accidents occur at 30 mph - whereas both 30 mph and 60 mph account for the majority of fatal accidents. This could be due to the national speed limit, single carriageway roads having no central separation/reservation. 
-  Both mild and severe accidents have peaks at 08:00 and 17:00 hours, Monday to Friday which correlates to the peak commuting hours. Fatal accidents do not have a bimodal distribution, instead having a peak around 17:00 hours - likely caused by weary/impatient commuters.    



## Data

Data obtained from [UK Gov Road Safety Data](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data)
