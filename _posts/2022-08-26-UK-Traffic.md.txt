# Example Markdown Post


## Basic setup


Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:


`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md`


Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `filename` is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. `.md` is the file extension for markdown files.


The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a "*level 1 heading*" in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line `## File names` above.


## Basic formatting


You can use *italics*, **bold**, `code font text`, and create [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Here's a footnote [^1]. Here's a horizontal rule:

## Lists


Here's a list:


- item 1
- item 2


And a numbered list:


1. item 1
1. item 2


## Boxes and stuff


> This is a quotation


{% include alert.html text="You can include alert boxes" %}


...and...


{% include info.html text="You can include info boxes" %}


## Images


![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/logo.png "fast.ai's logo")


## Code


You can format text and code per usual 


General preformatted text:


    # Do a thing
    do_thing()


Python code and output:


```python
# Prints '2'
print(1+1)
```


    2


Formatting text as shell commands:


```shell
echo "hello world"
./some_script.sh --option "value"
wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png
```


Formatting text as YAML:


```yaml
key: value
- another_key: "another value"
```




## Tables


| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|-|-|
| A thing | Another thing |




## Tweetcards

[22:15] To [Durden]: probs for the best! as it's what i have to tell gremlins for private time 
[22:16] To [Durden]: I just wish, at times, I didn't have to be resilient.  It's tiring and I have had enough

[23:47] [Durden]: I feel like I do enough to support you, but I'm not obliged to feel attacked when I'm trying to explain and you're not listening. You made me pretty angry, so it's best we don't talk for the evening. 
[23:47] [Durden]: when I* 
[23:53] To [Durden]: I've never said you'd not done enough. If saying what you said that upset me, makes you angry then that's your prerogative. Just know, blanking me and stating you won'tspeak to me, instead of saying you're angry, will never bode well with me
