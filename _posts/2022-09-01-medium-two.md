title: Pump It Up - Machine Learning Prediction

## Project 

I took part in a [competition on DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/). I wrote up my exploratory data analysis and machine learning work on [Medium](https://medium.com/@lottes.salter).  You can find the [second article on the machine learning predictions here.](https://medium.com/@lottes.salter/pump-it-up-prediction-b96830a024a5)
