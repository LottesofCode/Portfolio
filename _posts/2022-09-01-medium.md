title: Pump It Up - Exploratory Data Analysis 
---

## Project 

I took part in a [competition on DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/). I wrote up my exploratory data analysis and machine learning work on [Medium](https://medium.com/@lottes.salter).  You can find the [first article on EDA here.](https://medium.com/@lottes.salter/pump-it-up-the-eda-bcdea9f8d4e2)
