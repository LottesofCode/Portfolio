description: A overview of my PhD work
---

The frictional ablation of cosmic dust deposits metals into the upper atmospheres of Earth and Mars, at altitudes between 80 and 120 km. Magnesium is one of the most abundant metals in this cosmic dust and large concentrations have been observed in the terrestrial atmosphere. Of particular interest is the Mg+/Mg ion neutral ratio, which is large in comparison with other meteoric metals such as iron and sodium.  Observations of low-lying ion layers in the Martian atmosphere have been proposed to consist of meteoric metals.
The aim of my PhD was to improve the understanding of its behaviour when it ablates from meteoroids in planetary atmospheres with a focus on magnesium chemistry in the upper atmospheres of Earth and Mars.
This was done through the kinetic study of
