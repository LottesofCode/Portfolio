# Introduction  

The frictional ablation of cosmic dust deposits metals into the upper atmospheres of Earth and Mars, at altitudes between 80 and 120 km. Magnesium is one of the most abundant metals in this cosmic dust and large concentrations have been observed in the terrestrial atmosphere. Of particular interest is the Mg⁺/Mg ion neutral ratio, which is large in comparison with other meteoric metals such as iron and sodium.   Observations of low-lying ion layers in the Martian atmosphere have been proposed to consist of meteoric metals.
The aim of my PhD was to improve the understanding of magnesium’s behaviour when it ablates from meteoroids in planetary atmospheres, with a focus on magnesium chemistry in the upper atmospheres of Earth and Mars.  

# The Science

## Earth's Atmosphere 

In the terrestrial atmosphere the peak concentration of Mg⁺ ions lie at higher altitudes (90 - 100 km) than the neutral Mg atoms (~89 km).  Other metals (Fe, Ca and Na) have been observed using ground-based [LIDAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar). However magnesium can not be viewed this way as the wavelengths required (280 and 285 nm for Mg⁺ and Mg, respectively) are absorbed by the ozone layer. Therefore, satellite and rocket measurements were utilised to measure the concentrations, altitudes and global densities of the Mg⁺ and Mg layers.  A striking difference between magnesium and other meteroic metals is the large ratio between Mg⁺ and Mg - which is even more striking as Mg⁺ is not depleted relative to other metals in the upper atmosphere. This could not be explained by differential ablation, which affects the Ca⁺/Ca ratio. Thus, a difference in chemistry was the likely answer to this ratio, and will be dicussed in the results section.
