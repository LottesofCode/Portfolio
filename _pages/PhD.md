# Magnesium Chemistry in the Upper Atmosphere of Earth and Mars

This page offers a brief overview of the work undertaken during my PhD - with a focus on modelling and analysis. 

# Introduction  

The frictional ablation of cosmic dust deposits metals into the upper atmospheres of Earth and Mars.  Magnesium is one of the most abundant metals in this cosmic dust and large concentrations have been observed in the Earth’s upper atmosphere.
In the terrestrial atmosphere the peak concentration of Mg⁺ ions lie at higher altitudes (90 - 100 km) than the neutral Mg atoms (~89 km). Other metals (Fe, Ca and Na) have been observed using ground-based LIDAR. However magnesium can not be viewed this way as the wavelengths required (280 and 285 nm for Mg⁺ and Mg, respectively) are absorbed by the ozone layer. Therefore, satellite and rocket measurements were utilised to measure the concentrations, altitudes and global densities of the Mg⁺ and Mg layers. A striking difference between magnesium and other meteoric metals is the large ratio between Mg⁺ and Mg - which is even more striking as Mg⁺ is not depleted relative to other metals in the upper atmosphere. This could not be explained by differential ablation, which affects the Ca⁺/Ca ratio. Thus, a difference in chemistry was the likely explanation for this ratio, and will be discussed later[LINK].   

## Experimental

The aim of the experimental systems was to make gas phase kinetic measurements so that rate coefficients could be obtained - to help facilitate the understanding of the chemistry of magnesium in the upper atmosphere.  I undertook measurements on many of the reactions shown in the scheme below.

Two experimental systems were utilised; PLP/LIF (pulsed laser photolysis/ laser induced fluorescence) and a fast flow tube. These will not be discussed in detail here, but I gained a vast amount of experience using lasers, pumps, timing instruments, vacuum systems and a mass spectrometer.  I will not discuss these systems here, however, detailed experimental setups are available in [my publications](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lottes-salter/details/publications/). 

## Analysis

The following reactions were studied in the PLP/LIF system:

Mg⁺ + O₃ → MgO⁺ + O₂  
Mg⁺ + N₂O (+ He) → Mg⁺.N₂O (+ He)  
Mg⁺ + X (+ He) → Mg⁺.X (+ He) (where X = O₂, CO₂, H₂O and N₂)
