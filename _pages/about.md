Accomplishing [my PhD](https://lottesofcode.github.io/Portfolio/PhD/) in Chemical Physics sparked a passion for data and analysis. After a long fought battle in the gas kinetics laboratory - to gather said data -  I carried out computational modelling and statistical analysis to obtain rate coefficients.  The resulting knowledge enabled understanding of the behaviour of magnesium atoms and ions in the upper atmospheres of Earth and Mars. This knowledge was utilised in atmospheric models, which explained behaviour discovered via satellite observations and has led to several [journal publications](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lottes-salter/details/publications/) and international presentations. 

During a career break, to raise a family, I turned this enthusiasm towards building and bolstering the skills necessary to establish a career in data analytics.  I have gained aptitude in [Python](https://lottesofcode.github.io/Portfolio/fastpages/jupyter/2022/06/22/date-a-scientist.html) (notable libraries: Pandas, NumPy, SciKit-Learn, Matplotlib and Seaborn), [SQL and Tableau](https://lottesofcode.github.io/Portfolio/sql/tableau/mssql%20server/excel/2022/08/26/UK-Traffic.html); and have utilised these skills in various projects, as evidenced in my here in my [portfolio.](https://lottesofcode.github.io/Portfolio/)

I am a highly motivated, organised and analytically minded problem solver who has used the skills obtained during my education, employment and career break to push forward with a career path I am eager to follow. My abilities are well-rounded, including excellent written and verbal communication skills, gained through publications in academic journals and presentations to audiences of varying expertise and background.  

Being self-motivated and ambitious, I am committed to forging ahead with a data analytics career. You can contact me on lottes.salter@gmail.com.
