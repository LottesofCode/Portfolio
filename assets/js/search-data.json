            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 . Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png . Formatting text as YAML: . key: value - another_key: &quot;another value&quot; . Tables . Column 1 Column 2 . A thing | Another thing | . Tweetcards .

          "content": "Introduction . The frictional ablation of cosmic dust deposits metals into the upper atmospheres of Earth and Mars, at altitudes between 80 and 120 km. Magnesium is one of the most abundant metals in this cosmic dust and large concentrations have been observed in the terrestrial atmosphere. Of particular interest is the Mg+/Mg ion neutral ratio, which is large in comparison with other meteoric metals such as iron and sodium. Observations of low-lying ion layers in the Martian atmosphere have been proposed to consist of meteoric metals. The aim of my PhD was to improve the understanding of magnesium’s behaviour when it ablates from meteoroids in planetary atmospheres, with a focus on magnesium chemistry in the upper atmospheres of Earth and Mars. . The Science . In the terrestrial atmosphere the peak concentration of Mg+ ions lie at higher altitudes (90 - 100 km) than the neutral Mg atoms (~89 km). This difference in altitudes means the key reactions for atoms and ions will differ, as shown in the figure below. . . Experimental . If you would like to read further into the ion reactions, you can find my published journal article here .",

          "content": "Accomplishing my PhD in Chemical Physics sparked a passion for data and analysis. After a long fought battle in the gas kinetics laboratory - to gather said data - I carried out computational modelling and statistical analysis to obtain rate coefficients. The resulting knowledge enabled understanding of the behaviour of magnesium atoms and ions in the upper atmospheres of Earth and Mars. This knowledge was utilised in atmospheric models, which explained behaviour discovered via satellite observations and has led to several journal publications and international presentations. . During a career break, to raise a family, I turned this enthusiasm towards building and bolstering the skills necessary to establish a career in data analytics. I have gained aptitude in Python (notable libraries: Pandas, NumPy, SciKit-Learn, Matplotlib and Seaborn), SQL and Tableau; and have utilised these skills in various projects, as evidenced in my here in my portfolio. . I am a highly motivated, organised and analytically minded problem solver who has used the skill s obtained during my education, employment and career break to push forward with a career path I am eager to follow. My abilities are well-rounded, including excellent written and verbal communication skills, gained through publications in academic journals and presentations to audiences of varying expertise and background. . Being self-motivated and ambitious, I am committed to forging ahead with a data analytics career. You can contact me on lottes.salter@gmail.com. .",
